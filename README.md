# Heart Failure Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the primary global cause of death, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives annually, constituting 31% of all global fatalities. Approximately four out of five CVD-related deaths result from heart attacks and strokes, with one-third occurring prematurely in individuals under 70 years old. Heart failure, a frequent consequence of CVDs, is addressed in this dataset, encompassing 11 features suitable for predicting potential heart diseases.

Timely detection and management are crucial for individuals with cardiovascular disease or those at a high cardiovascular risk, characterized by the presence of risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing conditions. In this context, leveraging a machine learning model can prove invaluable.
